**RedisBungee** is the leading player synchronization system for BungeeCord.

RedisBungee shares data using the [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store.

RedisBungee is currently used in production on several large and well-known Minecraft networks, making it a logical addition to your network if you are looking to grow.
